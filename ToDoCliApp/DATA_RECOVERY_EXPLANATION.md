# üîç **Why Your To-Do List Disappeared and How It's Fixed**

## üìã **What Happened?**

Your to-do list disappeared because the application was saving data to **different locations** depending on where you ran the `dotnet run` command:

### **The Problem:**
- **Yesterday:** You ran from `/Week2CLISprint/` ‚Üí Data saved to `/Week2CLISprint/todo.json`
- **Today:** You ran from `/Week2CLISprint/ToDoCliApp/` ‚Üí Data saved to `/Week2CLISprint/ToDoCliApp/todo.json`

This created **two separate files** with different data!

## üìÇ **Your Data Recovery:**

### **Yesterday's Data (Found!):**
```json
1. Create CLI App (‚úÖ COMPLETED - Due: July 10, 2025)
2. Modify CLI App (‚ùå PENDING - "This is the hard part")
```

### **Today's Data:**
```json
3. Bob Item 1 (‚ùå PENDING - "First item (why did it disappear from yesterday?)")
```

## ‚úÖ **The Fix Applied:**

### **1. Changed Storage Location**
- **Before:** `"todo.json"` (relative path - changes based on run location)
- **After:** `%APPDATA%\ToDoCliApp\todo.json` (absolute path - always the same)

### **2. Data Migration Completed**
- ‚úÖ Merged all your data from both locations
- ‚úÖ Assigned unique IDs to avoid conflicts
- ‚úÖ Preserved all dates, notes, and completion status
- ‚úÖ Saved to permanent location: `C:\Users\juliab\AppData\Roaming\ToDoCliApp\todo.json`

## üéØ **How to Run Your Application (Updated)**

### **From ANY directory, run:**
```powershell
cd "d:\Users\aajuliab\Projects\ChatGPTBobJ\Week2CLISprint\ToDoCliApp"
dotnet run
```

### **Your recovered data will show:**
```
| # | Name              | Created      | Due        | Done | Notes                              |
|---|-------------------|--------------|------------|------|----------------------------------- |
| 1 | Create CLI App    | 2025-07-09   | 2025-07-10 | [x]  |                                    |
| 2 | Modify CLI App    | 2025-07-09   | -          | [ ]  | This is the hard part              |
| 3 | Bob Item 1        | 2025-07-10   | -          | [ ]  | First item (why did it disappear...|
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Prevention - This Won't Happen Again**

### **Why It's Fixed:**
1. **Consistent Storage:** Always saves to the same location regardless of run directory
2. **Auto-Directory Creation:** Creates the data directory if it doesn't exist
3. **Robust Error Handling:** Better error messages if file operations fail

### **Data Location:**
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\ToDoCliApp\todo.json`
- **Full Path:** `C:\Users\juliab\AppData\Roaming\ToDoCliApp\todo.json`

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Next Steps:**

1. **Test the application:** Run `dotnet run` and verify all your data is there
2. **Add new items:** They'll be saved to the permanent location
3. **Run from anywhere:** The app will always find your data

## üîß **Technical Details:**

### **Code Changes Made:**
```csharp
// OLD (problematic):
const string FileName = "todo.json";

// NEW (fixed):
static readonly string FileName = Path.Combine(
    Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData),
    "ToDoCliApp", 
    "todo.json"
);
```

### **Directory Auto-Creation:**
```csharp
// Ensures the directory exists before saving
var directory = Path.GetDirectoryName(FileName);
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(directory) && !Directory.Exists(directory))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(directory);
}
```

## üéâ **Your Data is Safe!**

All your to-do items from yesterday and today have been recovered and merged. The application now uses a consistent storage location that won't change based on where you run it from.

**Test it now:** Run `dotnet run` and you should see all 3 items in your list!
